Follow the steps below to test the API endpoints using these curl commands:

1. REGISTER A USER  
   Register a new user by replacing the 'username', 'password', and 'role' fields with your desired values:

   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"username": "example_user", "password": "password1", "role": "user"}'
   ```


2. LOGIN AS USER 
   You will Obtain a JWT token by logging in with your registered credentials:
   
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"username": "example_user", "password": "password1"}'
   

   Copy the token from the response. It will be used for authentication in the rest of the  requests.


3. CREATE A TASK  
   Create a new task using the token obtained in the login step. Replace '<YOUR_TOKEN>' with your JWT token:

   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
   -d '{"title": "Task Title", "description": "Task Description", "status": "pending"}'
   

4. GET ALL TASK BY LOGGED IN USER  
   Retrieve all tasks for the logged-in user:
   
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>"


5. GET ALL TASK BY ADMINS  
   Admin users can fetch all tasks:

   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/admin/tasks \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN>"
   

6. UPDATE TASK  
   Update a specific task by its ID. Replace '<TASK_ID>' with the task's ID and '<YOUR_TOKEN>' with your JWT token:

   curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/tasks/<TASK_ID> \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
   -d '{"title": "Updated Title", "description": "Updated Description", "status": "completed"}'
   


7. Delete TASK  
   Delete a specific task by its ID:

   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/tasks/<TASK_ID> \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>"



NOTE:
 Ensure your MySQL database is running and the required tables are set up as per the database creation script.

By following these steps, you can test all the endpoints of the Task Management API.
